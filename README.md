This code was used in my final year project at Monash University, which was a transistor curve tracer.

CurveTracer.py runs on a RaspberryPi. It requires NumPy, Matplotlib, PyQt5 and a modified version of Pyky040 included here.
The original source for Pyky040 can be found [here.](https://github.com/raphaelyancey/pyKY040)

Teensy.ino runs on a Teensy 3.6 microcontroller, and is compiled using Teensyduino.
